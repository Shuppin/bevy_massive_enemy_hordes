# Top Down Shooter with Massive Enemy Hordes

This is a learning project to get a better grasp on Bevy and to explore efficient algorithms for handling massive groups of entities.

It is a reflection of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8d8TKo59LU) tutorial, with some of my own modifications.
